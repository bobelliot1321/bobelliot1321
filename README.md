- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bobelliot1321. Just joined. Can anyone point me to a C++ program that plots rectangular coordinates version of the radiation pattern envelope of a large Diameter to wavelength ration, e.g. 20 to 80. Some antenna manufacturers, e.g. RFS, Commscope have something like it. Thank you.
